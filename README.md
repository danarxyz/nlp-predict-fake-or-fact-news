# NLP Fake News Classifier

This project is part of my learning journey in Natural Language Processing (NLP).  
It uses sentiment analysis and fake-news classification using VADER, CountVectorizer, and Logistic Regression.

## âœ¨ Key Features

- **Sentiment Analysis** using VADER
- **Text Preprocessing**: Lowercasing, Regex cleaning, Stopwords removal, Tokenization, Lemmatization
- **Vectorization** using CountVectorizer and TF-IDF
- **Fake News Classification** using:
  - Logistic Regression
  - Naive Bayes
  - Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- **Model Evaluation** using accuracy, precision, recall, f1-score
- Data visualization with Matplotlib & Seaborn
- Dataset: *TripAdvisor Hotel Reviews*, *TripAdvisor Hotel Reviews*, *BBC News*, *Book Review Sample*, *Fake News Data*, *News Articles*

## File Structure
- `data/`: Contains the raw CSV dataset
- `notebooks/`: Contains the full practice notebook used during training


## ğŸ§  Learning Objectives
- Understand core concepts in NLP through hands-on implementation
- Build classification models based on text data
- Evaluate models with real-world datasets
- Learn how to structure and document a data science project

## Status
This project is under active development as part of my NLP course from Udemy by 365 Careers.
Expect updates as I learn more advanced techniques like Topic Modeling (LDA/LSA) and Deep Learning-based NLP.
